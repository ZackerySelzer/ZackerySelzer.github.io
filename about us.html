        Bringing Tradition to Today
        </H2>
        <p>
        Our philosophy is simple. We want to provide you with contemporary designed jewelery of high quality with strong elements of msaculinity, and heandcrated traditions and history. We want to provide you with options throughout the different lines of design all sharing the common characteristics of standards within the area of handcraftsmanship, functionalism, and beauty.<br/></p>
            
        <p>We are located in Denmark, the oldest Kingdom in the worldand land of the vikings. We are established on the island of Sealand in the harbor city of Korsor. Korsor has a very long tradition of trade, going back to 1241 A.C. and we are proud to continue the traditions and set our footprint in history.The company is consciously kept reasonably small; all the processes are done "in-house" in close cooperation within the company's different departments.Inheritance and innovation goes hand in hand with the Scandinavian and handcraft tradtions. We see it as our duty and opportunity to produce products which are relevant for the consumer, carry a statement and carry traditions in a new interpreatation to a new exclusive level.<br/></p>

        <h2>Our History</h2>

        <p>GOVESU have had a long prelude, which took its start in the beginning in fall of 2009 and winter of 2010 before it finally was established in 2014 by Zackery N. Selzer, Esben S. Sturluson and Jimmy T. Carentius.<br/></p> 
<p>In 2009,  while under an educational trip to the United States in the city of Belmont, right outside Boston, MA, in the beautiful scenic New England, discovered Carentius suddenly that everyday suddenly different that the Danish everyday. Life the United States is a type of  life that is very "unfiltered” where there is large support in addition to many veterans in need. Almost every city had its own veterans house that is very often visited by veterans from many different conflicts and wars.In that fall of 2009 Carentius , who had many tours behind him, saw and talked with Selzer, son of an American USMC officer who was in the Vietnam war, about life as a veteran and the how the war affects veterans. They talked a lot, and soon after they discovered that they had the same feelings that there were a lot of military veterans that needed help and they could make a difference.<br/></p>
<p>Carentius and Sturluson were both sent out as corporals in B-Coy that became hard hit during ”Operation Storm” in 1995 in the war in Balkan. After that, Sturluson og Carentius was sent out together with IFOR and had continuous contact with each other until 2012 where coincedently met again and together soon afterwards decided that they wanted to help military vets and began to form GOVESU with goal to help military veterans like themselves. <br/></p>
 <p>GOVESU began in the coastal city of Korsor which is located in central Denmark with a history the goes way back to the year to the year 1241. That is why it is totally natutal, that  GOVESU choose this area as it base in Scandinavia. Both one of Denmarks large navy bases and ground regiment is  located.</p>

 <h2>Why we are called GOVESU</h2>

 <p>GO for GO<br/>
...Is a action to "GO", help, and take action. A old military saying is that is burnt in the memory of many veterans is "The only thing that you can wrong, is not to do anything at all". Thats how the action "GO" came about. <br/>
<p>VE for VETERANS<br/>
...Is for Veteran.  The group that GOVESU is aiming to help and support are all Military Veterans. The company is aimed towards military veterans, their family members, and other groups, organisations, and individuals that want to support them. <br/>

<p>SU for SUPPORT<br/>
...Support, means a lot. A lot means that veterans are not alone. Support is can come in many different forms, what what is common to all of them is that we any small way can make a difference.
