        <p>
 In our creative studio we create our jewelry over open fire of around 1200 degreees. Each and every piece of jewerly is unique and is created by veterans in this studio. We work from the fundaments of old nordic traditions which is originally from the bronzeage around 1700.<br/>
<p>The lace we use originally comes from parachute lines that follows the high quality spedifications. In addition every armband is made at this site and is under serious quality control and by engaged veterans. 
The are 648 choice bracelets. They come in 9 different figures, 6 different colors, 4 materials, and comes in 3 lengths, 17cm, 19 cm, and 21 cm.
