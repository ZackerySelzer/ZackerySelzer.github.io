        <h2>Welcome to the world of GOVESU!!</h2>
        <p>
GOVESU's main objective was to help military in three ways:
<p> 1.  PROVIDING A VETERANS CAFE:  The veteran's cafe is for veterans, there family, and other individuals/organizations that want to also help veterans.

<p> 2.   SELLING HANDCRAFTED PRODUCTS:  GOVESU hires military veterans who want to help other military veterans by using their initiative, creativity, and time to create hand-made bracelets and other products that are sold. The veterans get paid for their work in addition to that every product that is sold, a small amount of the sale either goes back into GOVESU in order for the company to provide more services to veterans,  or given to other veteran organizations to continue their cause  in helping veterans.

<p> 3.  HIRING VETS IN THEIR PRODUCTION STUDIO: where veterans can come to use their creativity and time to create things that they can get paid for and what is produced is sold to help to support other veterans.
